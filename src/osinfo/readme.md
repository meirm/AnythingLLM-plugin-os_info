## OS Info

This is an agent skill for AnythingLLM that allows you to quickly retrieve information about your operating system, RAM, and CPU.

## Setup

1. Install the package by using its import ID from the AnythingLLM Community Hub and pasting that into the "Import ID" field in the AnythingLLM app.
2. Activate the skill by clicking the toggle button in the AnythingLLM app under the "Agent Skills" section.

## Usage

Once installed, you can ask the AnythingLLM app via `@agent` to get system information using natural language.

```
@agent what operating system am I running?
```

```
@agent how much RAM and CPU do I have?
```

```
@agent get my system information using osinfo
```

The plugin will return your OS type, total RAM, and CPU model/count in a clear format.
